Lab μ operation &amp; management group learning resources.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following abilities before you can continue to next section.

- [ ] Cross the GFW. You'll need google search for the reset of the requirements. Baidu is a terrible search engine for techniques.
- [ ] Search in English. Prefer searching in English to in Chinese, which will provide much more precise result.
- [ ] Basic programming skills. [Python][python] is the most basic language you should know.
  If you didn't know python at all, pick up [this site][python-learn] and quickly go through the interactive tutorials, including basic and advantage sections.
  If you encounter any problem, never mind, just skip them, since you may not use that knownledge at all, or you may reference to [python doc][python-doc].
  Python 3 is prefered over python 2, but by default, system python is always python 2, so try to know the difference between them, the version's difference should not be of too much trouble.
  Other language that you should take at a glance: [golang][golang], [node][node]
- [ ] Good git skills. Prefere command line interface as a new starter, then mix using cmd and gui.
  Go through [progit][progit], the first three chapters should be read carefully, the remaining chapters can be taken as advantage knowledgement for expert.
  There is a Chinese in-wall version of progit [translation][progit-zh].
  After mastering git(and GitHub), you should fork this project, and thanks to GFM, you can check the checkbox in this readme, for the convinence of tracking your procedure.
- [ ] Master [docker][docker], this is the fundamental components of Lab μ's infrastructure.
- [ ] Linux. For starter, [ubuntu][ubuntu](do not use ubuntu-kylin) is a good choice.
  But if you can afford a macbook, don't hesitate, it will highly improve your efficiency, unless you're expert on Windows & Linux mixing environment.
  If you can't afford a macbook, never mind, just install a secondary system on your notebook if you are windows user. Do not use virtual machine unless you have a powerful pc, but if you can afford a powerful pc, why don't you buy a macbook instead?
